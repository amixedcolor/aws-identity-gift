When developing features or documentation for this project, optimize for the three equally weighted judging criteria:

## 1. Potential Value

Prioritize solutions that are:
- Widely useful and accessible to diverse users
- Intuitive with clear UI/UX design
- Unique or differentiated from existing solutions
- Scalable and extensible for future needs

## 2. Quality and Design

Emphasize:
- Creative and original approaches to problem-solving
- Polished, thoughtful design choices
- Unique use of public resources (datasets, APIs, libraries)
- Delightful user experiences
